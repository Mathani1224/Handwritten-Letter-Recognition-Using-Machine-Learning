The Handwritten Letter Recognition Using Machine Learning project aims to classify handwritten letters based on image or textual features. Using data preprocessing, feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms like SVM, Random Forest, or Neural Networks, the model accurately identifies characters. This system enhances optical character recognition (OCR) applications, improving text digitization and automation in various fields like document processing and assistive technology.
